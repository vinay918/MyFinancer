# MyFinancer

As part of a personal project to learn fullstack web development, My Financer is an object-oriented web application that I am building to help users track their spending. Ultimate functionality is yet to be determined, but will be documented on this site as we go along. I would like to implement some machine learning analyses on the tracked data eventually, and to add some visualization using D3.js, but that is a problem further down the road.

The website is temporarily hosted at: http://vinays.sgedu.site/

Update: I have completed designing the header, and login systems. Right now, after the user logs in or registers, the information that is collected is displayed to the user for testing purposes. 

NOTE THAT THIS REPOSITORY WILL BE MAINTAINED AS A WEB APP TEMPLATE IN ITS CURRENT WORKING FORM WITH COMPLETE LOGIN FUNCTIONALITY.

To Do (down the road and will show up on another repository, utilizing this template):
1. Design database and make connection.
2. Add meaningful and thorough documentation to code.
3. Design UML to model problem.
4. Implement UML and functionality.
5. Track user interaction with website for future analytics.
